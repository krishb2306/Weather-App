# Weather-App

Welcome to my WeatherApp. I went with a simple yet informative UI design, which also has a nice background. All the weather is displayed inside low opcaity boxes to make it readable. At the very top you can enter a city, but the app opens with the data to Randolph, since it was made for local use. You can get the current temp at the top and then some extra info like; wind speed, feels like, UV Index, and cloudiness. The bottom then has a 7 day forecast with all the highs and lows.
